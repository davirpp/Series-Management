# Series Management
 
## A simple Python (like)CLI Program using PostgreSQL database for management of serie's progress
 
The SQL script for database and table creation is on [serie_query.sql](https://github.com/davirpp/Series-Management/blob/main/serie_query.sql)

* You can have your series progress organized in an Excel file, so to populate the database you can run [populating_db_excel.py](https://github.com/davirpp/Series-Management/blob/main/populating_db_excel.py) 
    * (Inside the program you can make an Excel backup file with the same configuration as the database)
    * You can find an example on [series_backup.xlsx](https://github.com/davirpp/Series-Management/blob/main/series_backup.xlsx)
